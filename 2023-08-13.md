Functional API is much more robust like it can actually help in issues like multiple inputs and outputs compared to the traditional sequential one.
Sequential is a straight line.
Functional model is graph.
A skip connection can be done via functional api looks like it would be useful in the future let's see what the future aholds.

Subclassing api is used much frequently i always used them in my old project never knew what was so special about it anyway?
They say maximum flexibility for custom architectures
Dynamic logic something
Research level work
Looks like it goes more fundamentally

Creating model and adding layers seems very problematic but is very simple to implement
Very unflexible


Sub classing gives flexibility to create custom architectures which have various behavior
New unknown custom layer that isn;t available in keras can also be implemented in here.

## The Functional API: Flexible and Powerful

Think of the Functional API as a versatile tool for building advanced models. It's like creating a roadmap with multiple paths instead of just a straight line. This approach is fantastic when you're dealing with complex situations involving many inputs and outputs. It can handle challenges like having different types of data flowing through your model.

A key advantage is its ability to incorporate skip connections, which are like shortcuts that help your model learn more effectively. This is crucial for building smarter and more accurate neural networks.

## Subclassing API: Crafting Custom Designs

The Subclassing API is like giving you a magic wand to design your own deep learning architecture. It's perfect when you want to go beyond standard models and create something entirely unique. Think of it as the ultimate tool for customizing your neural network.

This API lets you add new layers that aren't already available, giving you the freedom to experiment and explore new ideas. It's like being in a playground where you can build any structure you can imagine.

## Choosing the Right Path

In a nutshell, the Functional API is great for making intricate models that can handle different types of data and challenges. On the other hand, the Subclassing API is your go-to when you want to unleash your creativity and design custom architectures.

So, whether you're aiming for flexibility or pushing the boundaries of deep learning, these APIs have got you covered. Embrace the power of Functional and Subclassing APIs to create models that suit your needs and take your skills to the next level.

## FAQs

1. **What's the main benefit of the Functional API?**
   It's perfect for handling complex situations and different types of data in your neural network.

2. **When should I use the Subclassing API?**
   Whenever you want to create a completely unique neural network with custom layers and behaviors.

3. **Can I use both APIs together?**
   Absolutely! You can choose the best approach for each part of your project.

4. **What are skip connections, and why are they important?**
   Skip connections help your model learn better and create more accurate predictions by taking shortcuts through the layers.

5. **How do I decide which API to use?**
   Choose the Functional API for complexity and versatility, and the Subclassing API for custom designs and experimentation.
