There are 6 data analysis phases that will help you make seamless decisions:

### Step 1: Ask 🤔
- Define the problem you’re trying to solve
- Make sure you fully understand the stakeholder’s expectations
- Focus on the actual problem and avoid any distractions
- Collaborate with stakeholders and keep an open line of communication
- Take a step back and see the whole situation in context

### Step 2: Prepare 📦
- Decide what data you need to collect to answer your questions
- Organize data for usefulness
- Create security measures to protect data

### Step 3: Process 🧹
- Clean up your data to get rid of errors, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies
- Use spreadsheet functions to find incorrectly entered data
- Use SQL functions to check for extra spaces
- Remove repeated entries
- Check for bias in the data

### Step 4: Analyze 📊
- Sort and format data
- Perform calculations
- Combine data from multiple sources
- Create tables with your results

### Step 5: Share 📢
- Summarize your results with clear and enticing visuals using data viz tools like graphs or dashboards
- Communicate your findings effectively

### Step 6: Act 🚀
- Use your data analysis to make data-driven decisions
- Provide recommendations based on your findings

## SMART Questions 🤔❓
It’s a huge part of the job of a data analyst to ask questions constantly. And these questions must be effective in leading to key insights to solve various problems.

### Types of Questions
- Leading — A question that leads you to answer in a certain way (biased).
- Closed-ended — Yes/No questions. Rarely lead to valuable insights.
- Ineffective — Vague questions lacking context (e.g., "Do you like this game?").
- Effective — Questions following the SMART Methodology:
  - **S** — Specific questions are simple, significant, and focused on a single topic or a few closely related ideas.
  - **M** — Measurable questions can be quantified and assessed.
  - **A** — Action-oriented questions encourage change and problem-solving.
  - **R** — Relevant questions matter and are important to the problem.
  - **T** — Time-bound questions specify the time to be studied, limiting the range of possibilities.

### Fairness of Questions
Fair questions are clear, straightforward, and do not create or reinforce bias. They make sense to everyone. Unfair questions lead to unreliable feedback and missed opportunities for valuable insights.

## Different Career Paths in Data 💼
There are three core roles in the field of data:

- **Data Analysts** — Work with SQL, spreadsheets, databases, and often create business intelligence dashboards.
- **Data Engineers** — Responsible for turning raw data into actionable pipelines, collaborating with data analysts.
- **Data Scientists** — Work with clean data pipelines created by engineers and analysts, using machine learning and statistical inferences to solve complex problems.

You don’t have to decide on a specific path at the outset. Exploring these roles can help you discover your passion.

## Data-driven Decisions 📈📉
The more data we have, the bigger the problems we can solve and the more powerful our solutions can be. But responsibly gathering data is only part of the process. We also have to turn data into knowledge that helps us make better decisions.

- **Data-Driven Decision Making** — Using facts to guide business strategy. More likely to lead to successful outcomes.
- **Data-Inspired Decision Making** — Explores different data sources to find out what they have in common.

## Quantitative and Qualitative Data 📊
### Quantitative Data
- Specific and objective measures of numerical facts.
- Includes what, how many, and how often about a problem.
- Examples: Number of commuters taking the train to work every week.

### Qualitative Data
- Describes subjective or explanatory measures of qualities and characteristics.
- Includes things that can't be measured with numerical data.
- Helpful for answering "why" questions.
- Examples: Preferences, like why people prefer a certain celebrity or snack food over others.
- Qualitative data provides context to quantitative data.

## Importance and Benefits of Dashboards and Reports 📈
### Reports
- Static collection of data given to stakeholders periodically.
- Requires continual maintenance.
- Examples: Spreadsheets.

### Dashboards
- Powerful visual tools for data storytelling and real-time monitoring.
- Organizes information from multiple datasets into one central location.
- Saves time and offers insights.
- Tools used: Tableau, Power BI, etc.
- Benefits for data analysts and stakeholders include better decision-making and easy data visualization.

## Mathematical Thinking to Problem Solving ➕➖✖️➗
- Mathematical thinking involves logically breaking down problems and recognizing patterns in data.
- Helps in selecting the best tools for analysis and understanding various aspects of a problem.

## Big Data and Small Data 📊📉
- Data analysis depends on the size of your dataset.
- Small data is useful for day-to-day decisions.
- Big data covers larger, less specific datasets over longer periods.
- Useful for large-scale questions and decisions.
- Often requires breaking down before analysis.

## Before Solving a Problem, Understand It 🤔
- Define problems before attempting to solve them.
- Structured thinking involves recognizing the current problem, organizing information, revealing gaps and opportunities, and identifying options.
- A structured approach saves time, money, and resources.

## Balancing Needs and Expectations Across Your Team 🤝
- Effective communication with stakeholders is crucial.
- Identify stakeholders, understand their needs and concerns.
- Coordinate with other team members, especially when covering different aspects of the data.
- Balance stakeholder needs with project objectives.

## Balancing Expectations and Realistic Project Goals 🎯
- Data has limitations, and not all data may be available.
- Set realistic, objective goals.
- Communicate with stakeholders about potential issues.
- Avoid over-promising and maintain a realistic timeline.

## Staying Focused on the Objective 🎯
- Focus on the project's primary objective.
- Identify primary and secondary stakeholders.
- Know who manages the data.
- Identify sources of help when needed.

## Communication Best Practices 🗣️
- Effective communication begins with understanding your audience.
- Consider what your audience already knows and what they need to know.
- Choose the best communication method.
- Prioritize clarity and relevance in your communication.
