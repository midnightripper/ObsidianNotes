# Data Science Notes 📊📈📉

## Data 📂
Data is a collection of facts that can be used to draw conclusions, make predictions, and assist in decision-making.

## Data Analysis 📈📊
Data analysis is the collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.

The six steps of the data analysis process are ([data analysis life cycle](https://github.com/ksgr5566/Google-Data-Analytics/blob/main/1-Foundations:%20Data%2C%20Data%2C%20Everywhere/Week1-Introducing%20Data%20Analytics.md#data-analysis-life-cycle)):
- 💡 **Ask** questions and define the problem.
- 📦 **Prepare** data by collecting and storing the information.
- 🧹 **Process** data by cleaning and checking the information. Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset.
- 📊 **Analyze** data to find patterns, relationships, and trends.
- 📢 **Share** data with your audience.
- 🚀 **Act** on the data and use the analysis results.

## People Analytics 👥📊
People Analytics, also known as Human Resources Analytics or Workforce Analytics, is the practice of collecting and analyzing data on the people who make up a company's workforce to gain insights and improve company operations.

Data science, the discipline of making data useful, is an umbrella term that encompasses three disciplines: ***machine learning, statistics, and analytics***.

If you want to make a few important decisions under uncertainty, that is statistics. The excellence of statistics is rigor. They are very, very careful about protecting decision-makers from coming to the wrong conclusion.

If you want to automate many decisions under uncertainty, that is machine learning and AI. Performance is the excellence of the machine learning and AI engineer.

But what if you don't know how many decisions you want to make before you begin? What if you're looking for inspiration? You want to encounter your unknown unknowns. You want to understand your world. That is analytics. The excellence of an analyst is speed. How quickly can you surf through vast amounts of data to explore it and discover the gems, the beautiful potential insights that are worth knowing about and bringing to your decision-makers.

## Data Ecosystem 🌐
An ecosystem is a group of elements that interact with one another.

Data ecosystems are made up of various elements that interact with one another to produce, manage, store, organize, analyze, and share data. These elements include hardware and software tools, and the people who use them.

For example, you could tap into your retail store's database, which is an ecosystem filled with customer names, addresses, previous purchases, and customer reviews.

## Data Science 🧪
Data science is defined as creating new ways of modeling and understanding the unknown by using raw data.

Data **scientists** create new questions using data, while **analysts** find answers to existing questions by creating insights from data sources.

## Data Analytics 📊📉
Data analytics, in the simplest terms, is the science of data.

It's a very broad concept that encompasses everything from the job of managing and using data to the tools and methods that data workers use each and every day. Data, data analysis, and the data ecosystem all fit under the data analytics umbrella.

## Data-driven Decision-making 📈📊
Using facts to guide business strategy.

The first step in data-driven decision-making is figuring out the business need. Data alone will never be as powerful as data combined with human experience, observation, and sometimes even intuition. To get the most out of data-driven decision-making, it's important to include insights from people who are familiar with the business problem. These people are called **subject matter experts**, and they have the ability to look at the results of data analysis and identify any inconsistencies, make sense of gray areas, and eventually validate choices being made.

## Gut Instinct 🤔🤓
Gut instinct is an intuitive understanding of something with little or no explanation. This isn't always something conscious; we often pick up on signals without even realizing. You just have a "feeling" it's right.

Blending data with business knowledge, plus maybe a touch of gut instinct, will be a common part of your process as a junior data analyst. The key is figuring out the exact mix for each particular project. A lot of times, it will depend on the goals of your analysis. At the heart of data-driven decision-making is data, so analysts are most effective when they ensure that facts are driving strategy.

## Data Analysis Life Cycle 🔄
The process of going from data to decision.

Data goes through several phases as it gets created, consumed, tested, processed, and reused. With a life cycle model, all key team members can drive success by planning work both up front and at the end of the data analysis process. While the data analysis life cycle is well known among experts, there isn't a single defined structure of those phases. There might not be one single architecture that's uniformly followed by every data analysis expert, but there are some shared fundamentals in every data analysis process.
