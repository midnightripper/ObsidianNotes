### Algorithm

An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed for a specific task.

### Data and Decision Making

The goal of all data analysts is to use data to draw accurate conclusions and make good recommendations. It all starts with having complete, correct, and relevant data. While having solid data is crucial, it's equally important for data analysts to interpret the data accurately. Incorrect interpretation can lead to significant losses, but when used strategically, data can transform businesses and increase revenue. There's a difference between making decisions with incomplete data and making decisions with a small amount of data. Making decisions with incomplete data is risky, but sometimes, accurate data from a small test can lead to good decisions.

## Types of Data and Their Questions üìä

### Quantitative Data

Quantitative data deals with specific and objective numerical measurements. It answers questions related to "what," "how many," and "how often." These are measurable, numerical values.

### Qualitative Data

Qualitative data is subjective and explains qualities or characteristics that can't be measured with numbers. It helps answer "why" questions and provides context to quantitative data.

Data analysts often use both quantitative and qualitative data in their work. Quantitative data gives the "what," while qualitative data provides the "why."

## Data Presentation Tools üìã

### Reports

Reports are static collections of data provided periodically to stakeholders. They offer snapshots of historical data and are designed for easy reference. Reports are efficient for high-level historical data but require regular maintenance. They might not be as visually appealing, and they lack real-time data updates.

#### Pivot Table

A pivot table is a data summarization tool used for sorting, reorganizing, grouping, counting, totaling, or averaging data in a database.

### Dashboards

Dashboards display live, incoming data and provide a dynamic, interactive interface. They offer stakeholders direct access to evolving data, making them suitable for continuous monitoring but require labor-intensive design.

Dashboards can be strategic, operational, or analytical, depending on their focus and usage.

Dashboards help companies:

- Track historical and current performance.
- Define key performance indicators (KPIs).
- Identify potential issues and inefficiencies.

## Metric and Metric Goal üìè

### Metric

A metric is a single, quantifiable type of data used for measurement. Metrics represent a specific type of data and can be combined into formulas for analysis.

### Metric Goal

A metric goal is a measurable goal set by a company and evaluated using metrics.

## Mathematical Thinking üßÆ

Mathematical thinking involves logically breaking down problems step by step to analyze data and make informed decisions. It helps in selecting the right analytical tools and approaches.

## Small Data vs. Big Data üìäüìà

### Small Data

Small data comprises specific metrics over a short, well-defined period. It's suitable for day-to-day decisions but may not impact larger business operations significantly.

### Big Data

Big data involves larger datasets covering longer periods, often requiring breakdown and analysis. It's valuable for addressing large-scale questions and making significant business decisions.

Challenges with big data include data overload, accessibility issues, and maintaining data quality. However, it offers benefits like efficiency improvements, trend identification, market insights, and brand management.

### V Words for Big Data

- **Volume**: Refers to the amount of data.
- **Variety**: Describes the diversity of data types.
- **Velocity**: Indicates the speed of data processing.
- **Veracity**: Relates to data quality and reliability.

These considerations are vital for handling complex data sets effectively.
